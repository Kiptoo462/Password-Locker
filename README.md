# Password Locker
####  This is a python application.  July 30,2021
#### By **Kiptoo Victor**

## Description
This is python application project that manages login and signup credentials of a person for various accounts i.e. username and passwords for each account. It also stores the passwords and generates a unique password for a user. This helps me to consolidate and utilize concepts learnt this week.
 
## Setup/Installation Requirements
### Requirements
* Text editor
* Github
* Git
* Browser(google chrome)
  

### Setup
1. Clone the repo

```sh 
https://github.com/Kiptoo462/Password-Locker.git
  ```
2. Open Project in favourite code editor

  ```sh
  code . or atom . (depending on your favourite text editor.)
  ```
3. `cd` to Password-Locker folder.
4. Launch `index.html`with browser



## BDD
     The user should be able to ;
  + Create a password locker account with his /her details, a login username and password.
  + Store his/her already existing account credentials in the application. Assuming he/she already have a twitter account, he/she want to store his/her already existing twitter username and password in the application.
  + Create new account credentials in the application. For example, if he/she have not yet signed up for Instagram, he/she would want to create a credentials account for Instagram in the application and the application generates a password for him/her to use when he/she sign up for Instagram.
  + Have the option of putting in a password that he/she want to use for the new credential account. For example, when creating his/her Instagram credential account, he/she want to have an option of putting in the password he/she want to use instead of having the application generate a password for him/her.
  + View his/her various account credentials and their passwords in the application.
  + Delete a credentials account that he/she no longer need in the application.
